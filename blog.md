## About Me

I'm a first-year graduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I'm experienced in Java. I had a software engineering internship at Huawei, developing a web application using Java. And I have many project experiences including SpringBoot and JavaEE. And I'm also familiar with several front-end techniques such as JavaScript, AJAX, HTML because I have done some of the front-end development in projects. Besides, I'm experienced with relational databases such as MySQL and Oracle.
